      <h1>Prague Parks Chatbot</h1>


<p>The presented task is to create a chatbot, which would provide
information to it's users about various parks in Prague.
The chatbot has to be written in the clojure programming language,
hence some clojure research had to be done.
The team decided to use <a href="https://leiningen.org/">leiningen</a>, which
is a tool that helps automate projects written in clojure. There
is not any other alternative which would be a better choice, making
this decision relatively simple.</p>
    
<p>At this stage the chatbot is adapted for providing information only about
one specific Park - Bertramka. It will further be developed to do the same
for all other parks for which the required data is available.</p>

<p>The main task of the chatbot is giving information about
specified criteria and features of the park by searching for keywords
in user's input that match these criteria names (e.g. "wc", "playground").
Apart from this, the chatbot includes some basic responses imitating a natural
conversation (e.g. greetings, goodbye messages).</p>    

<p>A pattern matching methodology was chosen as the core chatbot
mechanism. Currently, the most popular way of making chatbots
is with the help of machine learning. However, from the conducted
research it seems rather evident, that clojure does not seem
to have very mature tools for doing machine learning. Thus, the team
decided to stick with the classical approach of using pattern matching.
Research was also done on chatbot systems working on such principles
such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a>.</p>

<p>For more fine tuned pattern matching the chatbot will be using
fuzzy string matching. The difference between fuzzy and regular
matching is, that the former allows matching words which are not
100% similar as the searched word. The team believes, that this
could help with the flexibility of the chatbot as a word can have
slight variations, but have the same meaning. With fuzzy matching
the chatbot could capture such words as valid keywords.
To achieve fuzzy string matching, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">levenshtein distance</a> is used, which allows to calculate the number of edits word 1 is away from word 2.</p>

<p>The work on the project is conducted on github, which is a hosting
    platform for software which uses the git version control tool.</p>

<p>The project uses the github actions feature, which allows
the use of automated building tools. The current workflow checks if
the program requires all the dependencies needed, checks for linting
errors and runs automated tests.</p>

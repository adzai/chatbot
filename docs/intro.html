<p>The presented task is to create a chatbot, which would provide information to it’s users about various parks in Prague. The chatbot has to be written in the clojure programming language, hence some clojure research had to be done. The team decided to use <a href="https://leiningen.org/">leiningen</a>, which is a tool that helps automate projects written in clojure. There is not any other alternative which would be a better choice, making this decision relatively simple.</p>
<p>The work on the project is conducted on github, which is a hosting  platform for software which uses the git version control tool.</p>
<p>This project uses <a href="https://github.com/features/actions">github actions</a>, which allow the use of automated building tools. The current workflow checks if the program requires all the dependencies needed, checks for linting errors, warnings and runs automated tests. The whole project was managed from <a href="https://github.com/adzai/chatbot/projects/1">the project page</a> on github.</p>
<p>The main goal (creating a chatbot which answers questions about Prague parks) was split into many smaller goals. Some became milestones , other were were tracked under <a href="https://github.com/adzai/chatbot/issues">issues</a>. The created sub tasks allowed everyone to pick one to work on and thus allowing work in parallel, as these tasks did not depend on each other. Another added benefit of this approach is the fact that separate modules were created. These modules were designed to only achieve their specific task. This makes it easy to write a module and write tests for it, which verify the module’s functionality at every stage of the project. At the end, the modules were assembled together to create the chatbot. When new features had to be added, it was quite easy to extend an existing module or create a new one and just plug it in into the existing system.</p>
<p>The chatbot was supposed to answer questions about only 1 park at this stage - Bertramka. However, the data about all the parks was gathered at the start of the project. Since the code of the chatbot was well maintained and properly modularized, it was trivial to add the code for answering questions about all of the parks in Prague near the deadline for ICA1.</p>
<p>The main task of the chatbot is giving information about specified criteria and features of the park by searching for keywords in user’s input that match these criteria names (e.g. “wc”, “playground”). The chatbot functions on the synonyms of keywords, as well, thus increasing the comprehensibility of the user’s input. The chatbot includes some basic responses imitating a natural conversation (e.g. greetings, goodbye messages).</p>
<p>A pattern matching methodology was chosen as the core chatbot mechanism. Currently, the most popular way of making chatbots is with the help of machine learning. However, from the conducted research it seems rather evident, that clojure does not seem to have very mature tools for doing machine learning. Thus, the team decided to stick with the classical approach of using pattern matching. Research was also done on chatbot systems working on such principles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA">ELIZA</a>.</p>
<p>For more fine tuned pattern matching the chatbot will be using fuzzy string matching. The difference between fuzzy and regular matching is, that the former allows matching words which are not 100% similar as the searched word. The team believes, that this could help with the flexibility of the chatbot as a word can have slight variations, but have the same meaning. With fuzzy matching the chatbot could capture such words as valid keywords. To achieve fuzzy string matching, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">levenshtein distance</a> is used, which allows to calculate the number of edits word 1 is away from word 2.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
